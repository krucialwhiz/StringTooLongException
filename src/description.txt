1. Write a program that creates an exception class called StringTooLongException,
    designed to be caught and handled when a string is discovered that has too many
    characters in it. In the main driver of the program, read strings from the user until the user
    enters "DONE". If a string is entered that has too many characters (say 20), catch and
    handle the exception by printing an appropriate message, and then continue processing
    more strings. Allow the thrown exception to terminate the program.
